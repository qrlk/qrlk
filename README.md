### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I studied software engineering but now I'm more focused on fullstack web development.

I'm currently working on my first serious full-fledged web project: an **[adwhore.net](https://github.com/qrlk/adwhore.net)**'s successor.

In recent years, I have created more than 40 pet projects. Most of them are hosted here.

Most of my public projects are related to the GTA SAMP.

P.S. I'm not into mainstream social media, you probably won't find me there.
