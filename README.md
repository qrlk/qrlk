### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 22 y.o. programmer from St. Petersburg, Russia.

I'm currently working on my first serious full-fledged web project: the **[adwhore.net](https://github.com/qrlk/adwhore.net)**'s successor.

I studied software engineering in the past but now I'm more focused on learning fullstack web development.

I use github to host my open source projects.

P.S. I'm not into mainstream social media, you probably won't find me there.
